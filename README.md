# Hyperparameter-Search
### Implemented two hyperparameter searching techniques, Bayesian Optimization and Genetic Algorithm to search for hyperparmeters in two settings: a statistical machine learning algorithm and a deep neural network architecture. 

### Compared and analyzed these two techniques on the metrics of time complexity, search space exploration, memory requirement and parallelism capabilities.
