# Hyperparameter-Search
Implementing two hyperparameter searching techniques, Bayesian Optimization and Genetic Algorithm to search for hyperparmeters in two settings: a statistical machine learning algorithm and a deep neural network architecture. Comparing and analyzing these two techniques on the metrics of time complexity, search space exploration, memory requirement and parallelism capabilities.
